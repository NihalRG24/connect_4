# connect_4
Traditional connect 4 game played against an AI bot.

#moonraft
This project was made for the assessment round of the moonraft selection process

#language 

Project was built in python with the help of pygame library for display graphics.

#learning

The logic is pretty straight-forward, with 2d array manipulation and turn switching. The challenging part for me personally was building the graphics since I was not familiar with using pygame. The working of the AI bot also was a relatively hard to achieve.
